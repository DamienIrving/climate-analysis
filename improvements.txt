## List of improvements I plan to make ##

# Version control
  - Is bitbucket configured properly (sometimes it doesn't recognise who is submitting)

# Look into provenance tracking. It requires:
  - Unique identifiers and version numbers for raw data (e.g. complete details of the reanalysis data in download README file)
  - Unique identifiers and version numbers for all programs and libraries (e.g. python modules and NCL version)
  - Values of parameters used to generate any given output
  - Names and version numbers of programs (however small) used to generate those outputs (e.g. version numbers for my Python codes). 
  - Where possible this information should be included in the netCDF attributes
  - Use Sumatra (http://packages.python.org/Sumatra/)
    - I commented on a Software Carpentry post (http://software-carpentry.org/2012/10/wanted-an-entry-level-provenance-library/)
    - Apparently equivalent to using the 'revision' command for svn, that David Kent used to put in all his codes

# Improve general coding practices
  - Check that the 'calc_monthly_climatology' function in calc_climate_index.py is up to date with the one in calc_monthly_anomaly.py
  - Python has a style guide (see Appendix B.2 of Langtangen). 
    - I could build on this and create my own, adding standard ways to name input files, variables etc
  - Create my own Python cheat sheet, with things I commonly forget 
    - output formats (p 80, Langtangen)
    - variable interpolation (p 31)
    - 0 = false, 1 = true
    - copy and assignment ? it's different for Python lists (section 3.2.10, p 100, Langtangen) versus NumPy arrays (section 4.1.2, p 137)
  - Look into documentation generators. Perhaps I can generate html to put on my bitbucket wiki?
    - Epydoc is the only one that does both HTML and PDF or LaTeX
  - Start a code review group at uni?
  - Take the next step and learn about packaging code for sharing and 'release'
    - Tgis includes specifying the license and installation instructions/files
    - See https://ams.confex.com/ams/93Annual/webprogram/Paper223958.html

# plot_map.py development
  - Figure spacing issues (moves further right depending on how long the row headings are)
  - Vertical colourbar

# netcdf_io.py development
  - Include a linear detrending method?

# calc_waf.py development
  - Use f2py instead of the system calls (simple example, section 1.1.13 of Langtangen)

# LaTeX
  - Look into embedding vector graphics 
    - Using the latex command you can use .eps, but not .svg
    - Can't use any vector graphics with pdflatex, but really high resolution .png or .jpg might be sufficient
    - Investigate booktabs for nice Latex tables
