## Modules

These modules contain code that is used across many of my data analysis and visualisation scripts.

### Notes

* `coordinate_rotation.py` requires a library called `css`,
which I can only get via downloading [UV-CDAT](http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/).
That means I have to run it with `/usr/local/uvcdat/1.3.0/bin/python` instead of `/usr/local/anaconda/bin/python` 
* `convenient_universal.py` is named as such because it works with both uvcdat or anaconda
