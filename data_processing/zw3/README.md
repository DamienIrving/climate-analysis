Hi Damien,
I'm attaching a copy of my script.  It is written in ncl code which is a hodge-podge of Fortran and C and something else, but you should be able to follow the logic even though it is not fully commented. It is written to use the ERA-Interim data; the logic remains the same. You can open it using "vi" or treat it as a word document.  I have also attached a copy of the index values calculated from NCAR/NCEP 1948-2009 - I used NCAR-NCEP data for the 2004 and 2007 papers. The data are in netcdf, hopefully you can use that format.  I don't have it in ascii. I also have an updated dataset (up to 2012) at UCLA (I'm in Colorado) that I can send if this one is insufficient.  Please note that the Figure in the 2004 paper has an error that has since been removed. Between 1995 and 1997 there is a strong negative ZW3. This was due to an error in the NCAR-NCEP data set (undiscovered at the time) and that error has since been removed. 

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Marilyn
